The 100% easy to read standard
------------------------------

The `100e2r.css` is inspired by [IA' post](http://ia.net/blog/100e2r/)
which uses `normalize.css` as the base.

Features:

  * Good typography
  * Has style elements for [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
    so that when you are previewing documents written using pandoc, they
    show up nicely in preview.
  * The body font size is set at `140%`, which results in a font-size of
    about `16pt`s.
  * The column width is `23em` which translates to around `500px`, which
    is a good size for embedding images in an article.
