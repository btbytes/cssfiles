The 100% easy to read standard
------------------------------

The `100e2r.css` is inspired by [IA' post](http://ia.net/blog/100e2r/).



Features:

  * Uses [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as the
    base, to render all HTML elements consistently and in line with
    modern standards.
  * Good typography with easy to read font size and line-spacing.
  * Has style elements for [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
  * The body font size is set at `140%`, which results in a font-size of
    about `16pt`s.
  * The column width is `23em` which translates to around `500px`, which
    is a good size for embedding images in an article.
